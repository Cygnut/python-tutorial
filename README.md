# Python Tutorial
This is a tutorial aimed at beginners - albeit with a working knowledge of other programming languages.

The tutorial is example heavy - if you perform a local checkout, every example provided (surrounded by `# %%`) can be run in most editors as an isolated cell.

This tutorial is targeted at Python >= 3.5.
