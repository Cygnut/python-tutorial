"""If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made 
(functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, 
you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running 
it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets 
longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want 
to use a handy function that youâ€™ve written in several programs without copying its definition 
into each program.

To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in 
an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from 
a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables 
that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
"""

"""For the purpose of this tutorial, we're not going to go into much depth about creating modules
and packages. One very valuable area we will cover is the fact that Python includes a set of 
modules built into the interpreter - standard modules. These provide a rich array of services
and can be considered one of Python's 'killer features' - we'll list a few below!

To import a module, use the import-statement. This should be done at the top of the file, and
this will initialise the module (if it's the first time during the application runtime that
it has been imported), and then bring the name into scope as a method for accessing the contents
of the module. This is much like export/import in modern javascript & typescript.

All imports should generally, apart from in exceptional circumstances, be located at the top
of the file, rather than loaded dynamically (to avoid race-conditions and interdependencies).
