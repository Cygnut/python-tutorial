"""What is Python?
Paraphrasing from https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/:

  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level 
  built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding...

  Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no 
  compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad 
  input will never cause a segmentation fault.

  Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the 
  exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. 

  A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, 
  setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python 
  itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. 

  On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the 
  fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

Okey doke!

"""Context - what's Python used for (at least in Feed It Back..):
- Quick scripts
- Data analysis
- Kirsty originally used it in the deploy - largely because of the ease of integration & packages e.g. argparse & ssh.
